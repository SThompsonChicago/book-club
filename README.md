## Description
This application allows a user to leave a review of a book they have read, giving other users the chance to view different opinions about a single book.

Many technologies went into making this application function the way it does.
  *Node js
  *Express
  *Dotenv
  *Dayjs
  *Express-handlebars
  *Express-session
  *Bcrypt
  *Connect-session-sequelize
  *Sequelize
  *Mysql

A future goal we have for this application is to link it to GoogleBooks API, in the hopes of allowing a user to search for a book, which will then populate the database, and allow the user to review that book.
